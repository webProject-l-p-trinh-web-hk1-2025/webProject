FLAG: Several well-established high school computer security competitions, such as CyberPatriot and US Cyber Challenge, focus primarily on systems administration fundamentals, which are valuable and marketable skills. However, we believe the true purpose of a high school computer security competition should not only be to teach practical skills but also to spark students' interest and excitement in computer science. Defensive competitions often involve tedious tasks, such as running checklists and executing configuration scripts. The flag is UTECTF{X0R_15_4W3S0M3_4ND_1_4M_53CR37_5P4R73AN5_15_4W3S0M3}. In contrast, offensive security emphasizes exploration, improvisation, and elements of play, making it a more engaging way to inspire students. We believe that an offensively oriented competition is a better vehicle for tech evangelism among American high school students. Furthermore, understanding offensive techniques is crucial for building an effective defense, as the tools and configuration focus of defensive competitions does not equip students to understand their adversaries as well as learning to think like an attacker. picoCTF is an offensively oriented high school computer security competition designed to ignite curiosity in computer science, teaching students enough about security to motivate self-directed exploration and empower them to better defend their systems.
